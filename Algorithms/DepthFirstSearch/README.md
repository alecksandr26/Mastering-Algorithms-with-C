Sometimes we encounter problems in which we must determine an acceptable ordering by which to carry out tasks that depend on one another. Imagine a set of classes at a university that have prerequisites, or a complicated project in which certain phases must be completed before other phases can begin. To model problems like these, we use a directed graph, called a precedence graph, in which vertices represent tasks and edges represent dependencies between them. To show adependency, we draw an edge from the task that must be completed first to the task that depends on it.
