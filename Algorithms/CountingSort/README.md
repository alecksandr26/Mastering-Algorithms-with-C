# Counting Sort
Counting sort is an efficient, linear-time sorting algorithm that works by counting how many times each element of a set occurs to determine how the set should beordered. By avoiding the comparisons that have been a part of the sorting methods presented thus far, counting sort improves on the O(n lg n) runtime bound of comparison sorts.
