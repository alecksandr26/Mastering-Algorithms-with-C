# QuickSort
Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm, It is widely regarded as the best for general use. Like insertion sort, it is a comparison sort that sorts in place, but its efficiency makes it a better choice for medium to large sets of data.
Returning to the example of sorting a pile of canceled checks by hand, we begin with an unsorted pile that we partition in two. In one pile we place all checks numbered less than or equal to what we think may be the median value, and in the other pile we place the checks greater than this. Once we have the two piles, we divide each of them in the same manner, and we repeat the process until we end up with one check in every pile. At this point, the checks are sorted.
