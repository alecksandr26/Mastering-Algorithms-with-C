# Binary Search
Binary search is a technique for searching that works similarly to how we might systematically guess numbers in a guessing game. For example, suppose someone tells us to guess a number between 0 and 99. The consistently best approach is to begin with 49, the number in the middle of 0 and 99. If 49 is too high, we try 24, the number in the middle of the lower half of 0 to 99 (0 to 48). Otherwise, if 49 is too low, we try 74, the number in the middle of the upper half of 0 to 99 (50 to 99). We repeat this process for each narrowed range until we guess right.
