# Tree Traversals

## Preorder traversal:
In a preorder traversal for a given subtree, we first traverse its root, then to the left, and then to the right. As we explore subtrees to the left and right, we proceed in a similar manner using the left or right node as the root of the new subtree.
## Inorder traversal:
In an inorder traversal for a given subtree, we first traverse to the left, then to the root, and then to the right. As we explore subtrees to the left and right, we pro- ceed in a similar manner using the left or right node as the root of the new subtree.
## Postorder traversal:
In a postorder traversal for a given subtree, we first traverse to the left, then to the right, and then to the root. As we explore subtrees to the left and right, we pro-ceed in a similar manner using the left or right node as the root of the new subtree.
