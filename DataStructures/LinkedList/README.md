# Linked List:
Linked lists are some of the most fundamental data structures. Linked lists consist
of a number of elements grouped, or linked, together in a specific order. They are
useful in maintaining collections of data, similar to the way that arrays are often
used. However, linked lists offer important advantages over arrays in many cases.
Specifically, linked lists are considerably more efficient in performing insertions
and deletions. Linked lists also make use of dynamically allocated storage, which
is storage allocated at runtime. Since in many applications the size of the data is
not known at compile time, this can be a nice attribute as well.
# Linked List Example: Frame Management
An interesting application of linked lists is found in the way some systems support virtual memory. Virtual memory is a mapping of address space that allows a
process (a running program) to execute without being completely in physical
memory, the real memory of the system. One advantage of this is that a process
can make use of an address space that is much larger than that which the physical memory of the system would allow otherwise. Another advantage is that multiple processes can share the memory of the system while running concurrently
