# Linked Lists Chapter 5:
Linked lists are some of the most fundamental data structures. Linked lists consist
of a number of elements grouped, or linked, together in a specific order. They are
useful in maintaining collections of data, similar to the way that arrays are often
used. However, linked lists offer important advantages over arrays in many cases.
Specifically, linked lists are considerably more efficient in performing insertions
and deletions. Linked lists also make use of dynamically allocated storage, which
is storage allocated at runtime. Since in many applications the size of the data is
not known at compile time, this can be a nice attribute as well.
