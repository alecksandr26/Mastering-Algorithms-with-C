# Sets
Abstract datatypes based on the mathematical concept of a set. Sets are unordered collections of related members in which no members occur more than
once.
Determining interesting relationships between sets of data. For example, the
intersection of two sets tells which members are present in both sets. The difference of two sets tells which members of the first set do not appear in the
second set.
Specifically, combinatorics and probability. Sets have their own principles and
rules that computers help apply. Computers are especially useful when working with large sets, which may contain many thousands of members. Operations with sets of this size, like operations in mathematics with large numbers,
are very tedious to carry out by hand.
