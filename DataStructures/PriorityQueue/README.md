# Priority Queue
Priority queues are used to prioritize data. A priority queue consists of elements
organized so that the highest priority element can be ascertained efficiently. For
example, consider maintaining usage statistics about a number of servers for which
you are trying to do load balancing. As connection requests arrive, a priority
queue can be used to determine which server is best able to accommodate the
new request. In this scenario, the server with least usage is the one that gets the
highest priority because it is the best one to service the request.
