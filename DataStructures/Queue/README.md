# Description of Queues
The distinguishing characteristic of a queue is that it stores and retrieves data in a first-in, first-out, or FIFO, manner. This means that the first element placed in the queue is the first to be removed. A convenient way to think of a queue is as a line at the post office. In fact, anyone who has been to England knows that to form a line there is known colloquially as “queuing up.” As the line grows, newcomers join in at the tail. When a clerk becomes available, the person at the head of the line goes next. In computing, to place an element at the tail of a queue, we enqueue it; to remove an element from the head, we dequeue it (see Figure 6-2). Sometimes it is useful to inspect the element at the head of a queue without actually removing it, in which case we peek at it.
