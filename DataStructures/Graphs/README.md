# Graphs
Flexible data structures typically used to model problems defined in terms of relationships or connections between objects. Objects are represented by verti-ces, and the relationships or connections between the objects are represented by edges between the vertices.
## Search methods
Techniques for visiting the vertices of a graph in a specific order. Generally, either breadth-first or depth-first searches are used. Many graph algorithms are based on these basic methods of systematically exploring a graphâ€™s vertices.
