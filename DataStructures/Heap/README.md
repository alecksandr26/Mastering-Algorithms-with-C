# Heaps
A heap is a tree, usually a binary tree, in which each child node has a smaller
value than its parent. Thus, the root node is the largest node in the tree. We may
also choose to orient a heap so that each child node has a larger value than its
parent. In this case, the root node is the smallest node. Trees like these are par-
tially ordered because, although the nodes along every branch have a specific
order to them, the nodes at one level are not necessarily ordered with respect to
the nodes at another. A heap in which each child is smaller than its parent is top-
heavy. This is because the largest node is on top. A heap in which each child is
larger than its parent is bottom-heavy.
