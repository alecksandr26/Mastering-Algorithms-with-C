#  Solution of Equations
One of the most fundamental problems in scientific computing is solving equations of the form f (x) = 0. This is often referred to as finding the roots, or zeros, of f (x). Here, we are interested in the real roots of f (x), as opposed to any complex roots it might have. Specifically, we will focus on finding real roots when f (x) is a polynomial.
