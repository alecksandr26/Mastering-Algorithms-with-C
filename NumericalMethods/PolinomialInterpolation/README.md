# Polinomial Interpolation
A method of approximating values of a function for which values are known at only a few points. Fundamental to this method is the construction of an interpolating polynomial pn(z) of degree â‰¤ n, where n + 1 is the number of points for which values are known.

There are many problems that can be described in terms of a function. However, often this function is not known, and we must infer what we can about it from only a small number of points. To do this, we interpolate between the points. For example, in Figure 13-1, the known points along f (x) are x0, . . ., x8, shown by circular black dots. Interpolation helps us get a good idea of the value of the function at points z0, z1, and z2, shown by white squares. This section presents polynomial interpolation.
